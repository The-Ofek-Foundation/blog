#### Heya there!

My name is Ofek Gila, and I'm a high school student living in California's Bay Area. After taking my school's Java course, I fell in love with computer programming, and indulged myself in the subject.

I've coded many programs in Java, including [Old Snakey], a [Maze Generator], [Gobblet], [Pentago], and even **[Atari Tanks]**! You can view all of my greatest projects in [my Github Organization][Github Organization].

Recently I switched from Java to Javascript, so that my projects could be viewed by anyone on any device (although most of my projects are still funky on mobile devices). I also started becoming interested in Computer AIs for zero-sum games, such as [minimax][Minimax Wiki] and [Monte Carlo][Monte Carlo tree search] methods.

All my knowledge in Artificial Intellegence is self taught, *I don't claim to be an expert*, although my current AI's for games are generally very powerful, especially [my Connect Four program](/ConnectOfek/) that uses a Monte Carlo tree search.

**Be sure to check out [my website](/)!**
